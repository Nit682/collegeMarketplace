# College Marketplace

Hi, my name is Nitish. Here is a preliminary build of the e-commerce site called College Marketplace. This React project serves as means to help first-year college students like myself conveniently transact dorm essentials. I built this project in React as a serverless application in a Node.js environment. The styling is powered by TailwindCSS and MaterialsUI. All application data related to users, posts, or messages persist in Google cloud's firebase. I integrated this React-firebase application with Algolia for quick compound data search and indexing.

Here is a link to a detailed overview of the site: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1im_UXEp4O0VMpzAdmAz4EjYFD_qO1whObTcFC0Bb3wE/edit?usp=sharing
